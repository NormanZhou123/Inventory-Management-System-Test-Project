There might be some problem using Visual Studio to debug, if that doesn't work, I suggest you go to Inventory.API directory and "dotnet run"

You can view all the inventory items and their status, including inventory count, inventory group, unit price
You can search items by name
You can identify low stock items by clicking on the quantity table head
you can also do operations through, see below:
